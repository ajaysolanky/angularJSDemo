This is a demo of Angular JS. Some key features:

-Stopwatch with start/stop ability
-Ability to type in a name and save the time
-A listing of all the saved names with their times, organized by lowest-to-highest time
-Ability to search through the saved records by filtering the names

NOTE: This app is pretty buggy in places (try pressing the start button multiple times), but that's because I wanted to keep it short and simple for the demo.
